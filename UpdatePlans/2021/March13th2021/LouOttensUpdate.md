# SNU TV Special update plans

## The Lou Ottens update

I have planned to create a digital cassette tape experience to emulate the feels of a cassette tape somehow. Recently on March 6th 2021, the creator of the Cassette tape, Lodewijk Frederik Ottens (21 June 1926 â€“ 6 March 2021) died. I will make these updates in his memory.

Ottens didn't just help invent the cassette tape, he remained an avid engineer for the rest of his life, and also developed video 2000 (VHS) and the compact disc (CD) along with other technologies.
